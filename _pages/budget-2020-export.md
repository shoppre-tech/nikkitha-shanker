<p>Things related to Export in the Budget 2020-21:</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>23 (9). Horticulture sector with its current produce of 311million MT exceeds production of food grains. For better marketing and export, we propose supporting States which, adopting a cluster basis, will focus on “one product one district".</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>45. To achieve higher export credit disbursement, a new scheme, NIRVIK is being launched, which provides for higher insurance coverage, reduction in premium for small exporters and simplified procedure for claim settlements.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>46. It is proposed to digitally refund to exporters, duties and taxes levied at the Central, State and local levels, such as electricity duties and VAT on fuel used for transportation, which are not getting exempted or refunded under any other existing mechanism. This Scheme for Reversion of duties and taxes on exported products will be launched this year.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>47. It is the vision of the Prime Minister that each District should develop as an export hub. Efforts of the Centre and State governments are being synergized and institutional mechanisms are being created.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<p>99. Many mid-size companies are successful domestically but not in export markets. For selected sectors such as pharmaceuticals, auto components and others, we propose to extend handholding support – for technology upgradations, R&amp;D, business strategy etc. A scheme of ` 1000 crore will be anchored by EXIM Bank together with SIDBI. Both these institutions would contribute ` 50 crore each. This ` 100 crore would be achieved towards equity and technical assistance. Debt funding of `900 crore from banks would be made available.</p>

<p>140. Our policy of Make in India has started giving dividends. India is now making world class goods and exporting such products. We have made considerable progress in medical equipment too. Till few years back we were dependent on imports for medical equipment. Now, not only we are manufacturing medical equipment but also exporting them in large quantities. This sector deserves further fillip. Government has also been committed to provide health services to all. Ayushman Bharat has made it possible. To achieve the twin objectives of giving impetus to the domestic industry and also to generate a resource for health services, I propose to impose a nominal health cess, by way of a duty of customs, on the imports of medical equipment keeping in view that these goods are now being made significantly in India. The proceed from this cess shall be used for creating an infrastructure for health services in the aspirational districts.<br></p>
