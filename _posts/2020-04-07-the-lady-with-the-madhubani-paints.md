<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>As we interact with many such Ethnic Sellers, I decided to write a series on some of these Ethnic Indian Sellers.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Today I would like to introduce you to Smt. Asha Jha, a legendary Madhubani virtuoso.</p>

<p>Smt. Asha Jha is an artist of nationally renowned fame, a mother of five girls, recently, a grandmother, &amp; one of the truest symbols of women empowerment in India. She was a middle-class housewife with a seemingly absurd dream of forever revolutionizing the face of Madhubani.</p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Through sheer hard work and unmatched vision, she changed the outlandish dream into a living day reality, which reshaped the lives of thousands of unemployed craftswomen. She is being widely regarded as the woman who resurrected Madhubani and turned it into a modern-day extravaganza. While preserving the authenticity of the art has been compromised, she felt the need to take Madhubani to the global platform.</p>

<p><strong>Madhubani Art &amp; History:</strong></p>
<!-- /wp:paragraph -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Madhubani art originated at the time of Ramayana and is practiced in the Mithila region of Bihar and the Nepal border. It is a local belief that the Madhubani tradition of painting started when king Janaka commissioned regional artists to paint murals in his palace to prepare for his daughter Sita’s marriage to Lord Rama.<br></p>

<p>The term Madhubani means forest of honey, possibly stemming from the lush greenery that this region has always enjoyed. Madhubani art is culturally done in an exclusive manner, deploying natural dyes such as charcoal, turmeric, sandalwood, indigo, ochre, lampblack with the assistance of contemporary brushes, twigs, leaves, sticks, and fingers.</p>

<!-- /wp:group -->

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>Interestingly, Mithila is a matrilineal society where mothers pass on their inheritance to their daughters. Girls are encouraged to paint right from their childhood.&nbsp;</p>
